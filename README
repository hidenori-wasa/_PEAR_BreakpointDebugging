I freeze this Git's repository because I divide this package to some packages for generality and readability.

The basic concept
    This is package for breakpoint debugging.
    Also, you can use as basics of other PHP program or PEAR package if you want
    because this package has necessary minimum features.

The features list
    "php.ini"-file setting fixation feature, PHP code synchronization feature,
    error log feature by global handler, PHPUnit PEAR package extension feature,
    the override class feature and execution mode.
    Please, read the file level document block of "PEAR/BreakpointDebugging_Option.php".

The dependences
    OS requires "Linux" or "Windows", but may be able to require "Unix".
    PHP version >= 5.3.0

    Requires "Xdebug" extension in case of local host.
        "Xdebug" extension is required because (uses breakpoint,
        displays for fatal error and detects infinity recursive function call).
    Requires "Xdebug" extension if you want features of above in case of
        "$_BreakpointDebugging_EXE_MODE = B::REMOTE" mode. (optional).
    Requires "shmop" extension if you use "\BreakpointDebugging_LockByShmop" class. (optional).
    Requires environment which "flock()" enables
        if you use "\BreakpointDebugging_LockByFlock" class. (optional).

How to sniff my code.
    I customized code sniff because "which" statement indent is "PEAR" special.
    Therefore, default doesn't fit "IDE".
    Please, change following file.
        C:\xampp\php\PEAR\PHP\CodeSniffer\Standards\PEAR\Sniffs\WhiteSpace\ScopeIndentSniff.php
            before:
                protected $nonIndentingScopes = array(T_SWITCH);
            after:
                protected $nonIndentingScopes = array();
    Please, execute command like following.
        phpcs -n <full file path>
    Or, execute command like following with short cut file.
        %SystemRoot%\system32\cmd.exe /k phpcs -v -n "<full file path>"

Notice
    "Pear-Package/nbproject/" directory is project directory of "NetBeans IDE 7.1.2 for Windows".
    Also, "NetBeans IDE 7.3" cannot keep switchback in format at April, 2013.
    Example:
        if ($a
            && $b
            && ($c || $d)
            || ($e && $f)
        ) {
            return;
        }
    However, "NetBeans IDE 7.3" supports "PHP5.4" and "HTML5".

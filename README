The basic concept
    This package is for breakpoint debugging.

The features list
    Please, read the file level document block of "PEAR/BreakpointDebugging_Option.php".

The dependences
    OS requires "Linux" or "Windows", but may be able to require "Unix".
    PHP version >= 5.3.0

    Requires "Xdebug" extension in case of local host.
        "Xdebug" extension is required because (uses breakpoint,
        displays for fatal error and detects infinity recursive function call).
    Requires "Xdebug" extension if you want above in case of
        "$_BreakpointDebugging_EXE_MODE = B::REMOTE_DEBUG" mode. (optional).
    Requires "shmop" extension if you use "\BreakpointDebugging_LockByShmop" class. (optional).
    Requires environment which "flock()" enables
        if you use "\BreakpointDebugging_LockByFlock" class. (optional).
    Requires "PHPUnit 3.6.11" pear package
        if you use "\BreakpointDebugging::executeUnitTest()" class method. (optional).
        However, does not use "phpunit" command to debug its unit test file
        if array parameter element of "\BreakpointDebugging::executeUnitTest()" is one.
        Therefore, we can execute unit test with remote server without installing "PHPUnit".

How to sniff my code.
    I customized code sniff because "which" statement indent is "PEAR" special.
    Therefore, default doesn't fit "IDE".
    Please, change following file.
        C:\xampp\php\PEAR\PHP\CodeSniffer\Standards\PEAR\Sniffs\WhiteSpace\ScopeIndentSniff.php
            before:
                protected $nonIndentingScopes = array(T_SWITCH);
            after:
                protected $nonIndentingScopes = array();
    Please, execute command like following.
        phpcs -n <full file path>

Notice
    "Pear-Package" directory is project directory of "NetBeans IDE 7.1.2 for Windows".
    Also, "NetBeans IDE 7.3" cannot keep switchback at April, 2013.
    However, "NetBeans IDE 7.3" supports "PHP5.4" and "HTML5".

    I had executed unit test perfectly in Windows, but error occurred in sample.
    It is causes that release code cannot execute unit test.
    I corrected those, but package user cannot execute unit test in release code.
    Therefore, I will code following.
        Deletes "B::LOCAL_DEBUG_OF_RELEASE" mode.
        Includes unit test code by "\BreakpointDebugging_UnitTestCaller" class in case of "B::UNIT_TEST".
        Changes execution mode from "UNIT_TEST" to "DEBUG_UNIT_TEST" and "RELEASE_UNIT_TEST".
        Changes execution mode constant to "B::LOCAL, B::REMOTE, B::DEBUG, B::RELEASE, B::UNIT_TEST".
    Also, I will execute unit test in Linux.

    This package is for breakpoint debugging.

    Requires "Xdebug" extension in case of local host.
        "Xdebug" extension is required because (uses breakpoint,
        displays for fatal error and detects infinity recursive function call).
    Requires "Xdebug" extension if you want above in case of
    "$_BreakpointDebugging_EXE_MODE = B::REMOTE_DEBUG" mode. (optional).
